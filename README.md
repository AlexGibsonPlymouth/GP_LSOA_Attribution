## Population-weighted attribution of GP data to LSOAs

 This was developed to attribute GP-level **QOF data** to LSOAs, but in theory it should work with any GP-level count+denominator data on the PHE website.

 As usual, the R script is run in the Terminal (Windows) and takes a user-supplied 'driver file' which provides instructions as to which PHE datasets for which years are to be processed, along with a couple of additional parameters. 


 Instructions and further information to be provided!

 But, for the moment, download the R script by clicking on **GP_LSOA_Attribution.R** above, which will take you to its page, and then right-clicking on the **Raw** button - and save the R script to desired directory on your PC.

Then open up the **Terminal** on your PC and navigate to the directory in which you saved the *GP_LSOA_Attribution.R* file.

Type **Rscript GP_LSOA_Attribution.R** and follow instructions

 This then will download all data needed and tidy up afterwards. LSOA files will be saved to a sub-directory called **output**.
