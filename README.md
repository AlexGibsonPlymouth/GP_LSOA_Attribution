# GP_LSOA_Attribution

 This is for attributing GP-level QOF data to LSOAs (but should work with any GP-level count+denominator data on the PHE website).

 Instructions and further information to be provided!

 But, for the moment, download the R script by clicking on **GP_LSOA_Attribution.R** above, which will take you to its page, and then right-clicking on the **Raw** button - and save the R script to desired directory on your PC.

Then open up the **Terminal** on your PC
Type **Rscript GP_LSOA_Attribution.R** and follow instructions

 This then will download all data needed and tidy up afterwards. LSOA files will be saved to a sub-directory called **output**.
